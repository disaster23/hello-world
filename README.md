# hello-world
just another respitory

Hello everyone!
my names is Ness. I love computers and colors. Im in the process of building a gaming computer for my son who loves to game. 
I usually have alot of spare time on my hands to do this stuff. recently ive been getting into coding and ive been wanting
to get into it a little more. maybe actually get a job where i can code all day. sounds like a fun time for me.
